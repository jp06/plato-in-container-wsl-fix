Tentative plan:

- [x] docker compose for more structured `docker run options`
- [x] docker compose watch for auto `docker build`
- for `emulator` - try to remove `--network host`
- for `emulator` - narrower character special than `--device /dev/dri` (perhaps `card0`?)
- try emulator with `MuPDF` and `libmupdf-dev` Debian's testing repo with `libmujs-dev`
- cutting fat -> removing unnecessary Debian packages
- Debugging with Docker containers
- Using `Development container` specifications?
